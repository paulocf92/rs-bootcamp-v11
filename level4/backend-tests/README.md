# Level #4 - Backend Architecture and Tests

This module covers advanced backend architecture and test-driven development with NodeJS:

- Domain-Driven Development (DDD)
- Infra layer to handle solution-specific implementations
- Model layer to handle solution-agnostic interfaces (+scalability, +reliability)
- SOLID principles in action!
- Dependency Injection to further modularize services by reinforcing interfaces
- Applying controllers to reduce routing file responsibility
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) with Jest
- Code Coverage to ensure codebase reliability
- How TDD spikes insightful ideas to improve server scalability
