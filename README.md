# Rocketseat Bootcamp

This repo holds all code created for RocketSeat's Bootcamp version 11. Through this bootcamp we'll have a full grasp of the foundations of a FullStack app with Node (backend), React (frontend) and React Native (mobile). Besides these core technologies, a lot of extra tech is taught and they're explained in each sub-repository.
